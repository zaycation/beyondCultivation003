### 1. Increase Light Intensity and CO2

The easiest and most effective way to increase size, number, and density of buds is to increase the light intensity. As the lights are more intense, the plants are able to photosynthesize more and lied to better yields. Light is basically the **_food_** for your plants. They turn the light into energy through photosynthesizing. as a general rule of thumb, more intense light = larger plants and larger buds = larger yields.

During the vegetative stage, plants that don't receive enough light often stretch tall towards the light. It is very obvious to notice this immediately after the seedling pops. It is not necessarily a bad thing, but this will help you better understand how to properly place your lights. Aim for 18-24" above the plant for proper lighting in the vegetative stage.

Aside from light, increasing CO2 within your grow tent or area will also help increase yields. This slight change allows your plants to photosynthesize more efficiently and use even _more_ of the same light that is already provided.

### 2. LST, Topping, and Super Cropping

Low-stress training is one of the most common and recommended methods to increase yields since it is very low cost to do and some find it fairly relaxing to work on their plants at home. The idea behind the LST method, is that stretching the plants out wider leads to a more even canopy and allows light to hit all bud sites evenly (or just about evenly). This leads to more buds that are similar in size/weight. We highly recommend during week 5-8 to install a [trellis net](https://www.amazon.com/Tcamp-Heavy-Duty-Polyester-Trellis-Netting/dp/B07NV6B1Z2/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=trellis+net&qid=1620752596&sr=8-1) to make LST a lot easier.

Topping is another useful method growers like to use on their plants. This method involves cutting the very top single stem (where the largest cola would form). This will force the plant to split into two main large colas instead of just one. This helps with an even canopy size and also can even increase yields if done properly with LST.

"Fim"-ing a plant is a method almost identical to topping, but you trim it just a bit higher on the top/main stem. See image below to show the difference.

Super cropping is another popular training method. In this method, you bend the stem of the plant so that it may lay flat and form a "knuckle" where it has been bent. If you have installed a trellis and still notice one cola was taller than the rest, this could be a useful time to try super cropping to try and even out the canopy's height.

Please note that LST is a "low-stress" training method. In other words, this means that it won't shock your plants at all really or stress them out. Topping and super cropping are considered forms of high stress training for plants. Please be very specific about how you go about these methods. We strongly recommend that you do these methods as you feel necessary.

### 3. Using the Proper Nutrients

The proper nutrients should be provided regardless of the type of plant you are trying to grow. Since we recommend growing cannabis in coco coir, we strongly recommend using liquid fertilizer since coco has no nutes out the bag. My favorite brand to go with is [Technaflora](https://www.amazon.com/Technaflora-Recipe-Success-Kit-Starter/dp/B0792S1SYP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=2O14L3DCVQ978&dchild=1&keywords=technaflora&qid=1598155216&s=lawn-garden&sprefix=techn,lawngarden,196&sr=1-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=4200a7-20&linkId=c909fe642facb627229135d0d8ea1c15&language=en_US). They have a [great starter kit for around $60 USD](https://www.amazon.com/Technaflora-Recipe-Success-Kit-Starter/dp/B0792S1SYP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=2O14L3DCVQ978&dchild=1&keywords=technaflora&qid=1598155216&s=lawn-garden&sprefix=techn,lawngarden,196&sr=1-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=4200a7-20&linkId=c909fe642facb627229135d0d8ea1c15&language=en_US) that can be found on Amazon or most local hydroponics stores. This kit is awesome because it comes with a chart that explains the exact recommended feeding schedule for your plants!

### 4. Controlling Temp and RH (Relative Humidity)

Controlling temp and rh will strongly affect your yields. We have an extremely useful article about proper humidity and temps for every stage of the grow: [click here to view](https://beyondcultivation.com/humidity-temps-for-cannabis-growing).

By controlling temp and humidity you can actually improve the smell and potency of your buds. Too high temps can reduce potency and burn away cannabinoids and terpenes. We strongly suggest you invest in a [hygrometer](https://www.amazon.com/ThermoPro-TP50-Digital-Thermometer-Temperature/dp/B01H1R0K68/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=hygrometer&qid=1620754294&sr=8-5) for your grow space.

### 5. Harvesting Properly

Knowing _when_ to harvest can be one of the most difficult things for new growers. Harvesting within the harvest window can result in the best possible buds that are at their peak in potency. The
