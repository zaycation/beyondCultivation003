The following information is **not** a list of the causes for chlorosis. It is such a common symptom; so we have focused on the most common causes for yellowing cannabis leaves based on first hand growing experiences. If you are troubleshooting for a solution to chlorosis, read the next few sections carefully. Your resolution may be right below!

### THE MOST COMMON ISSUES:

##### UNDER/OVER WATERING

Cannabis plants (and many other plants) will only thrive with an effective wet-dry cycle. This means you must water the right amount at the right time, with every watering. So what's the best way to tell if your plants are thirsty? **Try weighing the entire plant in the pot on a scale before watering and after to gauge what the ideal weight should be.** This will definitely help you manage how much to water in the future.

Are you growing in a manner where it’s not possible to easily lift the plants? No problem. Then we recommend that you purchase a [humidity meter](https://www.amazon.com/iPower-Moisture-Garden-Gardening-Outdoor/dp/B075LRY5M7/ref=asc_df_B075LRY5M7/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=241883109355&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4009468868248142126&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9031788&hvtargid=pla-405973324768&psc=1) to insert into the pot. Hydro growers need to ensure pumps, air stones, reservoirs and timers are set up correctly from the start of the grow. _Always remember to check twice, and then check again._

##### PH AND NUTRIENT LOCKOUT

Soil growers have the advantage because the soil acts as a buffer for roots. Hydroponics and coco are not quite as forgiving to pH imbalances. Even soil growers need to at least come close to getting the ideal pH of 6.0-7.0 and maintain it. 5.5 to 6.5 pH is generally agreed upon as the recommended range for hydro and coco. Yellow leaves can be a warning sign, that you don’t have your nutes dialled in and the pH is off.

Essentially when the pH of your nutrient solution strays above or below the particular sweet spot for your substrate, it prevents complete absorption of all the elements of the solution. Roots are starved of certain nutrients and micronutrients as the incorrect pH causes a lockout.

##### OVER/UNDER-FERTILIZATION

A lack of key nutrients will cause cannabis leaves to turn yellow and wilt. Nutrient deficiencies can interrupt cannabis growth and prevent plants from carrying out vital functions. On the other hand, too many nutrients can cause nutrient burn, which also results in yellow leaves. Under-fertilization causes leaves to turn from green to yellow and eventually collapse, whereas over-fertilization causes leaves to become crunchy, vibrant yellow, and curly.

As a key macronutrient for cannabis plants, nitrogen deficiency or burn usually causes these symptoms. Nitrogen deficiency starts by yellowing the edges of leaves before working its way inwards. The central veins of each leaf remain dark green throughout this process. Nitrogen burn, on the other hand, gives rise to toxicity, which manifests as shiny leaves that are much darker green than usual.

##### LIGHT BURNS AND DEFICIENCIES

Indoor plants grown under artificial lights must be correctly positioned and the correct distance above the canopy for best results. When lamps and reflectors are too close to the flowering tops, buds and leaves will be yellow and brown as the light is too intense. This is very much a top down problem.

On the other hand, too little light is also a problem, that is most evident from the bottom up. Light deficiency causes shaded leaves or leaves too far below the light penetration capability of the lamp to yellow and drop off.

### FORCES OF NATURE

##### COLD WEATHER

Temperatures below 50°F will cause the leaves of the majority of cannabis leaves to yellow. Some will even take on purple and bluish tones. Of course, this is a fantastic bonus in the final phase of bloom with some strains, but to be avoided early in the grow.

##### HEAT WAVES

Heat waves can also cause cannabis fan leaves to yellow. Temperatures above 82.4°F can prevent cannabis plants from efficiently photosynthesizing and will result in loose and airy buds.

##### LEAF SEPTORIA

Leaf Septoria often leads to yellow cannabis leaves. This pathogen strikes the leaves of several plant species (cannabis, tomatoes, parsley, etc.) and it first presents itself as black spots on leaves. As the disease spreads, these spots swiftly spread from leaf to leaf and cause brown spots, yellowing, and wilting.

Leaf septoria typically grows rapidly during the early flowering phase. If untreated, the pathogen can destroy a large amount of foliage. Because cannabis plants depend on their fan leaves to fuel growth and create energy, excess damage can lead to stunted growth and reduced harvests.

##### ROOT ROT

Yellow leaves are a key sign of root rot, a microbial condition that attacks the root system of plants. When the growing medium becomes too damp from excessive moisture and over watering, it becomes a breeding ground for fungi, bacteria, and algae. Any of these organisms can begin to attack the roots in these conditions and cause them to start rotting. This leads to yellowing leaves, brown and slimy roots, leaf drop, and an overall droopy and withered look.

##### WHEN NOT TO WORRY ABOUT YELLOW LEAVES

Sometimes, we don’t need to worry about yellowing leaves. A fair amount of the time, this can be a natural part of the growing cycle. Cannabis plants shed older fan leaves (especially at the end of their life), which turn yellow and slowly wilt before falling to the ground. During flowering, plants divert most of their energy towards the flowers, which also tends to cause slight yellowing of the leaves

Flushing towards the end of flowering will also cause leaves to turn yellow and fall from their branches. This is extremely normal and not something to stress over since the plant is no longer consuming nutes and using its own resources to finish up the flowering process.
