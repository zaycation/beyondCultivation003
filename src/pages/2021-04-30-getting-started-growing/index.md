Anyone who has contemplated growing cannabis has been in the awkward phase of not really knowing where to begin. We hope to help you out with this blog post with where to begin, where to look, what tools you'll need, and what to research.

Indoor growing vs outdoor growing is often a pondered question amongst new growers. **If you have the capability to grow indoors, we will always recommend to try indoors!** Why? - Simple, it's because you will get better product because you can control the environment better. Also, there are more overall cons with growing weed outdoors like pests, criminals/theft, visibility (if you are in an illegal area), and unwanted weather conditions and humidity levels. So again: if you _can_, we'd recommend going with an indoor grow

Can you guess which one is outdoor.... I think you can.

##### Do I really need a grow tent?

Short answer: no. Grow tent's are obviously not required, but highly recommended. Without a grow tent, you would still most likely spend the same amount if not more on properly setting your room up than if you just shelled out the money for a tent. You also run the risk of a slightly less controlled environment if you opt for no tent.

##### How big of a space do I need?

We would recommend a [minimum of 2ft x 2ft](https://www.amazon.com/BloomGrow-24x24x48-Hangers-Hygrometer-Complete/dp/B07FF5PPJ1/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=bloom+grow+kit&qid=1619807174&sr=8-3) for a personal grow. You can squeeze up to 4 plants in a 2x2 tent which is more than enough for personal. Another good option is a [2x4 tent](https://www.amazon.com/Spider-Farmer-Complete-Compatible-MeanWell/dp/B088R4B8N2/ref=sr_1_13?dchild=1&keywords=grow+tent+kit&qid=1619807217&sr=8-13), i've seen people squeeze 6-8 plants in one of these!

##### Lights

Lighting is one of the most important parts of the grow. Improper lighting could result in mediocre results, whereas too much light could lead to light burns and other issues. A good rule of thumb is to read the range and spread of the lights. Also, search up ["grow tent kits"](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=grow+tent+kit&ref=nb_sb_noss) on amazon and check out what light they pair with that size tent.

##### Carbon Filter + Exhaust (Smell Removal)

This is the most important part for most people. A carbon filter exhaust kit can remove 100% of the smell from your tent if setup properly. I'd strongly recommend ***not*** skipping this important item in your tent. For most tents like the 2x2 or 3x3ft, just [a basic 4" carbon filter and exhaust fan kit](https://www.amazon.com/iPower-Inch-195-CFM-Inline/dp/B08BF5GWKZ/ref=sr_1_7?dchild=1&keywords=4%22+carbon+filter+kit&qid=1619819738&sr=8-7) should work just fine. Larger tents opf course require larger equipment.

##### Grow Medium

This topic comes down to whether you are interested in a hydroponic grow or an organic soil grow. Traditionally, soil and organic has always been the way to go, but we recommend [coco coir](https://www.amazon.com/Mother-Earth-Compaction-Resisted-Aeration/dp/B08BZKHVRP/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=coco+coir&qid=1619821467&sr=8-8), a dead substrate that mimics soil as a grow medium, but is truly hydroponic! We love coco coir because it's great for beginners, fairly easy  to work with, and almost **impossible to over water**. You can also reuse coco coir many times and some have reported having better grows after it has been broken in a few times!

###### Nutrients

Nutrients is the most important part of growing with coco coir because unlike soil, it comes with zero nutes and it does not hold nutes. The plants will consume them immediately. We recommend using the [following nutrients](https://www.amazon.com/General-Hydroponics-GLCMBX0026-FloraNova-KoolBloom/dp/B07TVSLX1C/ref=sr_1_7?dchild=1&keywords=calimagic&qid=1619821602&sr=8-7) with coco coir for the best results. You could even go super minimal and only use [CalMag](https://www.amazon.com/Botanicare-CAL-MAG-Plant-Supplement-Formula/dp/B004JKBMRW/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=cal+mag&qid=1619821636&sr=8-5) and you will be more than satisfied with your grow!
