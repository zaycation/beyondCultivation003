Cannabis in retrospect is a fairly easy plant to grow. With that being said, of course mistakes can happen to anyone! Even experienced growers get stuff wrong from time to time. This is why it's best to try and learn from our mistakes and try and not make the same ones repeatedly.

### 1. Not Understanding the Genetics that You're Growing

Although this may sound a bit strange, but this is something that happens occasionally. For example, let's say a buddy of yours gives you a bag of some awesome seeds. You immediately begin to germinate because you are so excited, but you have no idea what they are = are they indica, Sativa, the genetics, etc. This can already be a bit of an issue because you may not know how to properly grow these plants.

From a macro scale, weed is not just "weed". There are significant differences amongst seeds when it comes to growing characteristics and conditions. An indica autoflower strain will behave significantly different than a photoperiod sativa. Some strains are suitable growing ina colder climate, whereas others may require a very hot environment. Some strains need a bit more nutrients than others, and some require solely light feeding.

### 2. Improper Germination

Some grows fail before the seeds even pop. In this section, we'll go over some of the most common growing mistakes related to germinating seeds.

Here's what cannabis seeds need in order to pop:

- A dark and humid (but not wet) environment.
- Ideal germination temp of 70-80Â°F
- RH (relative humidity) between 70-90%
- Fluorescent lighting is optimal, but a windowsill might do. LED lighting is often mostly recommended.
- Avoid handling seeds (risk of damaging and contaminating seeds). We suggest wearing gloves when handling seeds
- Ensure the proper pH of the water (5.5-6.5)

##### Popular Germination Methods

- Glass of water method

  Fill a glass of water about halfway with room temperature water and add your seeds. Wait about 2-5 days, the seeds will have properly sprouted. Go ahead and transfer them (carefully and with gloves) over to your medium of choice and let the magic happen

- Paper towel method

  The paper towel method can be done with any sort of absorbent paper (paper towels, toilet paper, kleenex towels, coffee filters, etc). Carefully place your seeds on the paper a bit spaced apart and cover them up with a few more sheets of paper on top. moisten the paper towel with water and make sure it stays damp. This can be done best with a [cheap spray bottle](https://www.amazon.com/Tolco-Bottle-Frosted-Assorted-Colors/dp/B000H88PCU/ref=sr_1_omk_6?dchild=1&keywords=spray+bottle&qid=1620945289&sr=8-6). Be sure to spray or moisten if you feel the towel drying up a bit. We recommend putting the towel with the seeds in a tupperware container and leaving it in a dark and room temp place. After 2-5 days, you will then see tap roots sprout and it is time to add the seeds to your medium - **_tap root down first_**.

- Germinating directly in soil (oldest method in the book)

Germinating directly in the soil is my personal favorite method because there is a lot less risk involved related to contamination since you only touch the seeds once (when you place them in the soil). The best way to go about this method of germination is to fill your pot of choice up with your medium of choice. Dig a small hole with your finger thats about 2-4 inches deep and place your seed in the hole. Cover the whole up and water it with your pH'd water. **Important note**: be sure to not water your medium until runoff at this stage. only water the are where you planted the seed. It is easy to overwater if you are germinating directly in a 5gallon pot. If it is a small cup or 3gal pot, you may not have this issue. But watering a 5gal pot till run off before the seedling pops is a bad idea.
