### Temps/RH Based on Life Cycle:

##### Seedling Stage

- Seedlings/clones LOVE the high humidity levels **(60-70% RH)**
- Temp w/ lights on: 20-25 C° or 68-77° F
- Temp w/ lights off: 4-5 C° lower or about 40° F lower

##### Vegetative Stage

- Vegging plants like slightly less humidity **(40-70% RH)**
- Roots absorb more water, evaporation through leaves cools plants
- Temp w/ lights on: 22-28 C° or 70-82° F
- Temp w/ lights off: 4-5 C° lower or about 40° F lower

##### Flowering Stage

- Flowering plants **_need_** much lower humidity **(40-50% RH)**
- You can get away with 55%, but anything over 60% is considered bad
- It's best to slightly lower temps during flowering
- Temp w/ lights on: 20-26 C° or 68-78° F **(avoid high temps)**
- Temp w/ lights off: 4-5 C° lower or about 40° F lower

##### Late Flowering Stage

(1-2 weeks prior to harvest; flushing time)

- Bring humidity down to 30-40% **(40-50% RH)**
- Low humidity is extremely important for the best yield, flavors, and appearance.
- It's best to slightly lower temps during flowering
- Temp w/ lights on: 18-24 C° or 64-57° F **(avoid high temps)**
- Temp w/ lights off: 4-5 C° lower or about 40° F lower
