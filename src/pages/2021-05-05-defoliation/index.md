Defoliation is a heavily debated topic in the cannabis community. Some growers love to cut off almost all leaves, while others prefer to just do a few that are already dying off. What's "best" is up to your own interpretation. We recommend that you spend some time doing some additional research and finding what works best for you!

##### What is defoliation?

Although defoliation is a very simple concept, it's not impossible to over defoliate and stunt the plants growth or remove some important nodes that could've been some awesome buds! Although defoliation is a heavily debated topic, the basic question lies in "why would the plant create unnecessary foliage". Technically, you could never defoliate and have perfectly fine plants. However, of course defoliation is often recommended because you can maximize bud size and quality of the nuggs if done properly.

In a nutshell, defoliation is simply cutting off the foliage (leaves) that are "no longer needed" for the grow. Of course, every grower has their own techniques and preferences when it comes to defoliation, but nobody is truly "correct" at the end of the day. Outdoor growers often tend to shy away from defoliation as they often don't have many issues with light visibility within their canopies. On the flip side, an indoor grower may be only working with a 3x3 tent, and have so many fan leaves that the bottom canopy may not even see the light. This is why defoliation is extremely subjective and can vary depending on the grower.

**Proper defoliation techniques include using shears that have been disinfected with isopropyl alcohol. This is extremely important because if you do not disinfect them, this could lead to some sort of disease or infection for your plants.**

##### Benefits of defoliation

In an indoor grow, defoliation could lead to better air circulation in the tent due to less overall leaves. Aside from that, defoliating can also reduce the chances of mold and pest infestation from humidity build up.

##### Which leaves should I defoliate?

It is definitely not recommended to get rid of all of your fan leaves. The best leaves to defoliate are those that are yellowing and dying off. Aside from that, any leaves that are blocking/covering up bud sites may be useful to defoliate if you feel as if those bud sites are not getting enough light. Some growers like to defoliate branches with bud sites that look like they will be popcorn nuggs. This is a great idea too if you are looking for size/quality over quantity.
