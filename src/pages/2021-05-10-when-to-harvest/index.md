The "right" time to harvest is often one of the most debated about topics within the industry. Of course every grower has their own preference, but there are some general rule of thumbs for what we consider to be the "harvest window" which means the period of time (generally a few days) of which we recommend you harvest. If you harvest prior to the window, you result in lower overall THC content, and if you harvest after the window, you could get lose a lot of the [terpenes](https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/terpenes-the-flavors-of-cannabis-aromatherapy) and [flavanoids](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5465813/) within the buds.

The 6 images below are of buds that are within the harvest window. Buds are ready to harvest when most of the white "hairs" have darkened and curled inwards. You also will be able to see a solid amount of bud underneath the hairs.

Aside from the hairs, trichomes appear all around the buds and nearest fan leaves. These are huge indicators that will help determine when the buds are ripest and ready to harvest. When trichomes initially form, they are clear, see through, and glass-like. These are **_not_** ready for harvest because they are not yet potent. As the plant matures, the heads of the trichomes (top bubble like tips) begin to turn milky white and similar to plastic. These are when the plant is in it's stage with the highest level of thc and cbd.

If you wait a bit longer, the trichome heads will turn amber/golden. These typically have less THC, but produce more of a relaxing body effect. It has also been proven to help with anxiety.

##### TLDR Summary:

Cannabis plants are most mature and ready to harvest when the hairs have darkened and curled inwards; revealing the actual buds underneath them. Harvest buds earlier for more of a mind high, and later after the trichome heads turn amber.
