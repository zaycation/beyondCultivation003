The “lazy stoner” stereotype died years ago. Society now realizes that, for the most part, people who enjoy cannabis have the potential to become wildly successful. From Seth Rogan to Rihanna to Mike Tyson, some of the most dedicated and hard-working people in the world smoke weed. Even some daily!

Although easy to overdo, cannabis can be a useful tool to help enhance focus and fuel creativity with your work. However, on the flip side, if you over do it, you can definitely run the risk of reducing productivity. **Know your limits.**

### Different Ways to Get High

Before dicing in depth on using cannabis while working let's first explore the different ways to get high. We aim to assist you in better dosing depending on your method of consumption. This would ultimately support your motivation and focus while enjoying your high.

##### Smoking

Smoking flower is the traditional method and most original. Although smoking can expose the body to harmful carcinogens, for most, there is a unique and relaxing feeling about rolling up your own joint or blunt and letting that harsh smoke invade the lungs! **Smoking can hit some people in as quick as 10 minutes and leave a high lasting a couple of hours.**

##### Vaping

Similar to smoking, vaping can get consumers high almost instantly without combustion of the physical flower. Vaping heats the cannabis up enough to release cannabinoids and terpenes, but leaves plant matter, wax, etc completely out of the lungs. Vaping serves as a great alternative if you would like to avoid a loud and lingering smell.

##### Eating

Edibles can often produce a significantly more intense experience. When THC is digested within the human body, it converts to 11-hydroxy-THC. This can lead to a high that can last up to 8 hours and even be considered to be similar to a psychedelic trip. It can also take about 2-3 hours to fully feel the effects of an edible after consumption.

##### Tinctures

Tinctures are often drops of oils or extracts. This method of consumption leads to a fast acting and very potent experience.

### Preparing Correctly Prior to Work

##### Set Goals and Deadlines

Try setting some goals/deadlines within your work. This will show yourself the progress you've made an encourage you to keep going until you've finished. Try and set achievable and simple goals. Write everything down within a "to-do list" format so that way you can easily check off things you've done. If you're working on a much larger project that could take days or weeks to finish, try dividing the goals/deadlines up per day. If you have a 20 page paper due in a month, try aiming for 2-3 pages per day.

##### Remain Organized

Organization can be a huge setback in terms of efficiency within your work. The more organized you are, the easier it can be to get shit done! We know everyone can't be neat and tidy all the time, but maybe try dedicating 10-15 minutes prior to your work session just cleaning up your work area so you can be the most efficient. Once you're organized and have made goals, it doesn't matter how high you get, because you won't lose much focus or feel like you're procrastinating.

##### Eat a Good Meal

A balanced diet of course can help out a ton! As humans, we need the right nutrients to perform. before using cannabis, be sure to eat and give your body the nutes it deserves! This way those damn munchies can't distract you!

##### Know Your Limits

No one wants to be burnt out! It can be super enticing to just knock everything out at once, but remember that slow doesn't mean bad! This is why setting goals above plays a huge role in your success in trying to be high and productive. **Take things one step at a time to maximize your potential.**

##### Choose a Suitable Strain

As you may know, indica vs sativa can change how cannabis can affect you. When trying to be productive, definitely aim for sativa dominant strains if you can! These will help boost your focus and creativity. Indica's may work fine for some, but definitely not all! This goes hand in hand with knowing your limits!
