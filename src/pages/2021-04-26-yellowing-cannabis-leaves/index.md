COMMON CAUSES OF YELLOW LEAVES

The following is not a definitive list of the causes for chlorosis. It is such a common symptom, that sick plants display, we could write a book, but not today. That being said, we have focused on the most common causes for yellow leaves based on first hand pro grower experiences. If you are presently troubleshooting for a solution to chlorosis, read the next few sections carefully. Your crop could be riding on it.

THE MOST COMMON GROWER ERRORS

UNDER/OVER WATERING

Cannabis plants will only thrive with an effective wet-dry cycle. This means you must water the right amount at the right time, with every watering. So what's the best way to tell if your marijuana is thirsty? Lift up the containers when they are dry. Then again after watering, so you will know the difference.

Perhaps it’s not possible to easily lift plants? Then you can purchase a humidity meter to insert into the pot. Hydro growers need to ensure pumps, air stones, reservoirs and timers are set up correctly from the start of the grow. Check twice, and then check again.

PH AND NUTRIENT LOCKOUT

Soil growers have the advantage of cultivating in a medium, that acts as a buffer for roots. Hydroponics and coco are not quite as forgiving to pH imbalances. Even soil growers need to at least come close to getting the ideal pH of 6.0-7.0 and maintain it, otherwise plants will suffer. 5.5 to 6.5 pH is generally agreed upon as the recommended range for hydro and coco. Yellow leaves can be a warning sign, that you don’t have your nutes dialled in and the pH is off.

Essentially when the pH of your nutrient solution strays above or below the particular sweet spot for your substrate, it prevents complete absorption of all the elements of the solution. Roots are starved of certain nutrients and micronutrients as the incorrect pH causes a lockout.

OVER/UNDER-FERTILIZATION

A lack of key nutrients will cause cannabis leaves to turn yellow and wilt. Nutrient deficiencies can interrupt cannabis growth and prevent plants from carrying out vital functions. Conversely, too many nutrients can cause nutrient burn, which also results in yellow leaves. Under-fertilization causes leaves to turn from green to yellow and eventually collapse, whereas over-fertilization causes leaves to become crunchy, vibrant yellow, and curly.

As a key macronutrient for cannabis plants, nitrogen deficiency or burn usually causes these symptoms. Nitrogen deficiency starts by yellowing the edges of leaves before working its way inwards. The central veins of each leaf remain dark green throughout this process. Nitrogen burn, on the other hand, gives rise to toxicity, which manifests as shiny leaves that are much darker green than usual.

LIGHT BURNS AND DEFICIENCIES

Indoor cannabis plants grown under artificial lights must be perfectly positioned and lamps must be in just the right distance above the canopy for best results. When lamps and reflectors are too close to the flowering tops, buds and leaves will be yellow and brown as the light is too intense. This is very much a top down problem.

In contrast, too little light is usually a problem, that is most evident from the bottom up. Light deficiency causes shaded leaves or leaves too far below the light penetration capability of the lamp to yellow and drop off.

FORCES OF NATURE

COLD WEATHER

Temperatures below 10°C will cause the leaves of the majority of cannabis leaves to yellow. Some will even take on purple and bluish tones. Sure, this is a fantastic bonus in the final phase of bloom with some strains, but to be avoided early in the grow.

HEAT WAVES

Heat waves can cause cannabis plants leaves to yellow and dry out indoors and outdoors. Temperatures above 28°C prevent cannabis plants from efficiently photosynthesizing and cause buds to form more loosely and airy.

LEAF SEPTORIA

As a prolific fungal disease, leaf septoria often leads to yellow cannabis leaves. This pathogen strikes the leaves of several plant species—cannabis, tomatoes, parsley—where it first presents as black spots. As the disease spreads, these spots swiftly spread from leaf to leaf and cause brown spots, yellowing, and wilting.

Leaf septoria usually ramps up during the early flowering phase. Left untreated, the pathogen can destroy a large amount of foliage. Because cannabis plants depend on their fan leaves to fuel growth and create energy, excess damage can lead to stunted growth and reduced harvests.

ROOT ROT

Yellow leaves are a key sign of root rot, a microbial condition that attacks the root system of plants. When the growing medium becomes too damp from excessive moisture and over watering, it becomes a breeding ground for fungi, bacteria, and algae. Any of these organisms can begin to attack the roots in these conditions and cause them to start rotting. This leads to yellowing leaves, brown and slimy roots, leaf drop, and an overall droopy and withered look.

WHEN NOT TO WORRY ABOUT YELLOW LEAVES

Sometimes, growers don’t need to worry about yellow leaves. At times, they are merely a natural part of the growing cycle. Cannabis plants often shed older fan leaves (especially at the end of their life), which turn yellow before falling to the ground. During the flowering phase, plants divert most of their energy towards the flowers, which also tends to cause slight yellowing of the leaves

Flushing towards the end of the flowering phase will also cause leaves to turn yellow and fall from their branches. This intentional restriction of nutrients makes cannabis flowers taste so much better.
